# Enterprise SDD Philosophy & Design Boundaries

## Inviolable Constraints

Before proposing or planning ANY improvement to Enterprise SDD, these principles are non-negotiable:

1. **Constitution supremacy** — Every new feature must respect the project constitution. No feature may bypass or weaken constitution governance.
2. **Gate integrity** — Quality gates (Gate 1–4) remain mandatory. New features may ADD gates but never remove or weaken existing ones.
3. **Traceability chain** — US→AC→TC→Task→Code traceability must never be broken.
4. **Template discipline** — Agent outputs use templates. Free-form output is not acceptable for primary artifacts.
5. **Boundary rules** — Every agent has Always Do / Ask First / Never Do rules. New agents must define these before shipping.
6. **Additive evolution** — Each improvement adds capabilities without removing existing ones. Breaking changes require explicit migration guides.
7. **Team-oriented** — Enterprise SDD targets teams, not solo developers. Team collaboration, shared state, review gates are features.
8. **Tech-agnostic** — Domain knowledge belongs in constitution or `.instructions.md` files, NOT hardcoded in agents.
9. **Human-readable agent files** — The agent-based model is SDD's differentiator. Never propose replacing agents with programmatic state machines.
10. **Single dispatch per command** — Interactive and any future autonomous variants of an SDD command share one dispatch implementation; the difference is **policy + renderer**, not **code path**. Forking dispatch for guided vs. auto / interactive vs. CI / human vs. agent is a type-system-level bug that calcifies into multi-month parity gaps (see §8 Design Boundaries — "Dual dispatch paths" row, Wave 26 §25 #4, evidence: GSD-2 v3.0.0 #5786–#5789).

## Design Boundaries — What NOT to Adopt

| Rejected Pattern | Source | Reason |
|-----------------|--------|--------|
| Programmatic state machine | GSD-2 | Breaks agent-based model; sacrifices human-readable agent files |
| Agent-less CLI model | Spec Kit | Removes SDD's differentiating specialized agents with handoff guidance |
| Solo-only execution model | GSD v1/v2 | SDD targets teams; shared state and review gates are features |
| No-governance autonomous mode | GSD-2 | Quality gates are SDD's philosophical foundation; bypass contradicts spec-driven premise |
| Discussion/Writer agent pairs | AI Framework | Single-agent-per-phase with templates is proven superior |
| Hardcoded domain knowledge | AI Framework | Breaks tech-agnosticism; domain knowledge belongs in constitution or instructions |

## Feature Evaluation Criteria

When evaluating features from public frameworks for Enterprise SDD adoption:

**Accept features that:**
- ✅ Add capability WITHOUT breaking any of the 9 constraints above
- ✅ Fill a documented gap in Enterprise SDD
- ✅ Are compatible with agent-based + gate-driven model
- ✅ Can be implemented as new agents, instructions, skills, templates, or CLI commands
- ✅ Improve developer experience, quality, or team collaboration

**Reject features that:**
- ❌ Violate any of the 9 inviolable constraints
- ❌ Match a pattern in the Design Boundaries table
- ❌ Were already adopted in previous waves (check evolution doc)
- ❌ Are too narrow/niche for enterprise adoption

## Plan Task Conventions

When creating implementation plans for Enterprise SDD improvements:
- Priority: 🔴 High (blocks others), 🟡 Medium (important), 🟢 Low (nice to have)
- Effort: Low (< 1 hour), Medium (1-4 hours), High (> 4 hours)
- Status: ⬜ Not started, 🟡 In Progress, ✅ Complete
- Task numbering: `{Phase}.{Sequence}` (e.g., A.1, A.2, B.1)
- Every task must have acceptance criteria
- Dependencies must form a DAG (no circular dependencies)
