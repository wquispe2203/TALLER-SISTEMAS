## Article IV: Architecture Principles

### 4.1 Core Principles

1. **[Principle 1 Name]**
   [Explanation of the principle and why it matters]

2. **[Principle 2 Name]**
   [Explanation]

3. **[Principle 3 Name]**
   [Explanation]

### 4.2 Code Organization

```
[PROJECT_ROOT]/
├── src/
│   ├── [layer1]/          # [Description]
│   ├── [layer2]/          # [Description]
│   └── [layer3]/          # [Description]
├── tests/
│   ├── unit/              # Unit tests mirror src/ structure
│   ├── integration/       # Integration tests
│   └── e2e/               # End-to-end tests
├── docs/                  # Documentation
└── .specify/              # Specification artifacts
```

### 4.3 Dependency Rules

```
[Allowed dependency directions - use arrows]

UI Layer
    ↓
Service Layer
    ↓
Data Layer
    ↓
External Services
```

**Rules:**
- [Rule 1, e.g., "UI may not directly access Data Layer"]
- [Rule 2, e.g., "Services may not import from UI"]

### 4.4 API Design

- Style: REST / GraphQL / gRPC / Mixed
- Versioning: URL path (`/v1/`) / Header / Query param
- Naming: kebab-case paths, camelCase JSON fields
- Pagination: Cursor-based / Offset-based
- Error format: RFC 7807 / Custom

### 4.5 Error Handling

```typescript
interface ApplicationError {
  code: string;        // Machine-readable code
  message: string;     // Human-readable message
  details?: object;    // Additional context
  traceId?: string;    // Correlation ID
}
```

### 4.6 Logging & Observability

#### Logging
- Format: JSON structured
- Levels: `debug`, `info`, `warn`, `error`
- Required fields: `timestamp`, `level`, `message`, `traceId`

## Article V: Development Workflow

### 5.1 Branch Strategy

- **Model:** [GitFlow / Trunk-based / GitHub Flow]
- **Main branch:** `main` (always deployable)
- **Feature branches:** `feature/[ticket-id]-[description]`

### 5.2 Commit Messages

Format: Conventional Commits

```
<type>(<scope>): <subject>

[optional body]

[optional footer]
```

Types: `feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `style`, `refactor`, `test`, `chore`

### 5.3 Pull Request Requirements

**Before Opening:**
- [ ] Tests pass locally
- [ ] Linting passes
- [ ] Self-review completed

**Required for Merge:**
- [ ] [N] approving reviews
- [ ] CI pipeline passes
- [ ] No unresolved comments

### 5.4 Definition of Done

A feature is DONE when:

- [ ] Code complete and merged
- [ ] Tests written and passing
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] Code reviewed and approved
- [ ] Deployed to staging
- [ ] Product owner accepted

### 5.5 TDD Mode

```
tdd_mode: false  # Set to true to activate TDD enforcement via tdd-enforce.instructions.md
```

When `tdd_mode: true`, agents in the Software Engineer and Test Engineer roles must write
failing tests **before** writing any implementation code. Gate 2 will verify test stubs
exist prior to implementation tasks being unlocked.

## Article VI: Model Configuration

### 6.1 Model Tier Mapping

| Tier | Provider | Model | Fallback |
|------|----------|-------|----------|
| deep | Anthropic | Claude Opus 4.6 | Claude Sonnet 4.6 |
| standard | Anthropic | Claude Sonnet 4.6 | Claude Haiku 4.6 |
| light | Anthropic | Claude Sonnet 4.6 | Claude Haiku 4.6 |

### 6.2 Budget Controls

- Budget Ceiling: 50.00
- Warning Threshold: 80% of budget ceiling
- Hard Stop Threshold: 100% of budget ceiling unless explicitly approved

> **Note:** The `model-tier` field in agent definitions is resolved to the specific model
> at generation time by the adapter generator (`sdd adapters generate`). This allows
> switching LLM providers without modifying individual agent files.

### 6.3 Agent Tier Assignments

| Tier | Agents |
|------|--------|
| deep | architect, test-explorer, constitution |
| standard | requirement-analyst, clarification, api-champion, messaging-champion, gherkin-analyst, analysis, test-engineer, software-engineer, review, refactoring, agent-builder, instruction-builder, guidance-builder, prompt-builder, workflow-builder |
| light | brainstorming, tech-context-maintainer, workflow-builder |
